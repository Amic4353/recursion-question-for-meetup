## INSTRUCTIONS

A palindrome is a word that is spelled the same in reverse as it is forwards, such as "racecar" or "kayak".

Complete the 'isPalindrome' function in recursio.js, using recursion, so it can take an input string and return a true or false value to check if the input is indeed a palindrome.

## SETUP

Run:

```
npm i
```

Then run 'testem' in your commandline and follow the URL.
